Conway's Game of Life
=======
 
Game of Life project built for freeCodeCamp's data visualization certificate using React and Sass. The game is a cellular automaton devised by John Conway. 

The game is played on a grid, with each cell in one of two states "dead" or "alive". The rules are: 
 
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (simulating underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with greater than three live neighbors dies (simulating overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (simulating reproduction).
